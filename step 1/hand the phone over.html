    <h1> You handed the phone over </h1>
    <p> You wait for the crowd in front of the door to die down before giving your phone to the 
    teacher. After handing it over you start to walk into class before you realize something. Today 
    your first class is math and today there is a math test. You start to panic as you have not studied
    for this test. You get lost in your mind until the principal spots you still standing in the hall.
    Your panic attack caused you to stay out of the class. In your panicked state you are not sure what
    to do. You can either <a href="/step 2/walk over to the principal.html">walk over to the principal</a> or you
    can <a href="/step 2/run down the hall.html">run down the hall.</a>
