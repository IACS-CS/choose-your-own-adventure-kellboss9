    <h1>The quizzes were given back</h1>
    <p>
     you nervously look at the top of your page to see your score. It's a D. A tear starts to form
    in your eye as you know what will happen once you get home. You board the bus and play on your
  phone for the last time you will be able to for a while. Once you walk through the door your mom
demands your quiz from you. Begrudingly you hand it to her and watch her face explode into anger.
She snatches your phone and sends you to your room, a place you will be staying a lot over these next
couple of months.</p>
