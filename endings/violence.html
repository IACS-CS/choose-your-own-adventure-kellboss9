  <h1>violence works too...</h1>
  <p>
 You're not sure what came over you. Probably an extreme factor of stress. Something snapped and 
  you started running towards all the teachers. You feel your fist hit something before your mind 
   becomes blurry. Suddenly you regain control of yourself only to find you are in handcuffs and
  in the back of a police car. You look out the window and see your friends staring at you with 
disgust from the windows before a cop comes back to the car and drives you both away. I don't think
I will be coming home for a little while. </p>
