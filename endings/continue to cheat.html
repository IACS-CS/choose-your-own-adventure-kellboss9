    <h1>You abuse the power</h1>
    <p>
    You have decided to cheat. You cheat yet again on your history test. And again on your science test. 
  And again. And again. And again. And again. High school ends and you graduate at the top of your 
class. Honors and AP were no issue for you. Of course that was because you cheated but still. You go on 
to make it to an ivy league college. You continue to cheat. The work is even harder now so you have even 
more of a reason to right? You breeze through college top of your class and go on to live the life you 
always dreamed of. Except you didn't. During your sophmore year in college you are called to the principals 
office. You assume it is to congratulate you on your achievements so far, maybe even offer some type of 
reward. But that is not what happens. The college has proof that you cheated your way through their 
courses. You try to assure them that this is not true but they won't listen. They pull up your grades and 
answers on your assignments and ask you to write them an essay of that calibur right then to prove that 
you are as smart as you say. Obviously you can't do that and try to come up with some excuse to avoid it 
but they see right through you. After some back and forth you get expelled from the college. You shamefully 
go back to living with your parents, stuck in a depressive episode of your own making. Nowadays you just 
lay in bed, no longer going to work or seeing your friends since you are an outcast. In bed you think of 
the different things you could have done or the different paths you could have taken that would have not 
led you down this road. Maybe if you handed your phone over things would've been different. Maybe if you 
ran from your teachers things would've been different. Maybe if you had just stopped cheating after your 
math test things would've been different. But nothing will change what has happened. It is too late for 
you now. You will just continue to lay in bed and ponder on what could have happened on that school day.  </p>
