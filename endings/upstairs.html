    <h1>You run upstairs</h1>
    <p>
    You run up the stairs to the second floor, hoping to escape all the teachers. This does not work 
  out though, as the other floors have already been notified and were waiting for your arrival. You 
start to freak out and run back down the stairs. However, there are already teachers coming up the 
stairs. You start blindly running backwards away from the surrounding teachers until you hear a crash 
and feel a sudden thud before it all goes black. You wake up, strapped to some sort of bed. As you 
come to your senses you realize where you are. You are in an ambulance on the way to a hospital. You 
start to panic again before one of the paramedics takes out a needle and injects you with it. Before 
you can even react you fall back asleep. </p>
