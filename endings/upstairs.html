    <h1>You run upstairs</h1>
    <p>
    You run up the stairs to the second floor, hoping to escape all the teachers. This does not work 
  out though, as the other floors have already been notified and were waiting for your arrival. You 
start to freak out and run back down the stairs. However, there are already teachers coming up the 
stairs. You start blindly running backwards away from the surrounding teachers until you hear a crash 
and feel a sudden thud before it all goes black. </p>
