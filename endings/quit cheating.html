    <h1>You resist</h1>
    <p>
    You keep your phone in your pocket. You will not let the temptataion sway you into cheating yet 
  again. You do your history tests along with the rest of your tests the correct way, on your own. You 
pass with high Bs and graduate near the top of your class. It may not be perfect, it may not be the dream, 
but it is what you accomplished by yourself without having to cheat like so many people you know. You 
are proud of what you accomplished and strive to do even better once you reach college. </p>
