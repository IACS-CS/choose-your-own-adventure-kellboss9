   You determine that it isn't worth breaking her trust as there is no reason to and she just gave you 
  a free out to the math test. You make your way through the school. First to the third floor to grab 
the papers. Then throughout the school to deliver the fliers. Then finally back to the principal in her 
office to her her the leftover fliers. She was proud that you proved yourself to be a trustworthy student
and appointed you to be her official helper. Now whenever she needs help you will be called to assist 
which means free passes out of classes. I suppose good people get good things. </p>
