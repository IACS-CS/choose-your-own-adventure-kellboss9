    <h1>You took advantage of the opportunity</h1>
    <p>
   This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, to be able to roam the halls and visit your friends classrooms 
  without anyone being able to tell you otherwise. With this in mind you grab the fliers and walk 
  around the school, planning to visit all your friends and chill for the day. Every time a teacher questions 
  why you are there you just tell them that the principal has requested you to hand out papers. You spend 
the rest of the period finding your friends and saying hi, forgetting all about your responsibilities in 
the process. By the end of the day only half of the classrooms got the fliers. When the principal finds 
out she is mad and vows to never call you for help ever again, as well as making the math test grade to 
be a zero since you skipped the class to talk to your friends instead of doing the work. Your grade 
plummets end so you end up having to go to extra help after school every week for the rest of the semester 
to make sure you pass the class. You don't hate it though, after all it's the only time you will be 
outside of your house until the end of the school year. </p>
