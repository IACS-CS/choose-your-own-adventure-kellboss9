    <h1>You run to the basement</h1>
    <p>
   You basically jump down the stairs and run into the basement. You run down the empty hall and lock
  yourself in the very furthest room. You hear the teachers start clamoring down the hallway, checking
all the rooms. Your mind starts racing, making you wonder what you are going to do. That's when suddenly
a hand touches your shoulder and calls out your name. It turns out its your favorite teacher. They ask 
you whats going on and at first you try to run but with nowhere to go but into the crowd of angry teachers
you end up explaining the whole situation. You end up having a conversation with the teacher for a while
until you calm down. "Are you ready to go back out there?" they ask you. You nod your head and open 
the door, revealing all the teachers from before. But now they don't look so scary, they look more 
concerned. You apologize for your outburst and accept any punishment they offer. You get detention for 
a week but in the end everything turns out well.  </p>
