    <h1>You run away</h1>
    <p>
    Your heart starts racing as you dash in the other direction down the hall. Running past all the 
    classes causes other teachers to come out of their classes to check on what is going on. Soon 
    enough the hallway was crowded with teachers and students heads poking from the doorways. What
    can you even do? Its not like fighting is an option <a href="/endings/violence.html">right?</a>
    You continue to run until you reach a staircase. You look at it and see that it leads both
    <a href="/endings/upstairs.html">upstairs</a> and to the <a href="/endings/basement.html">the basement.</a> 
    Which way should you go?
