    <h1>Cheat the test</h1>
    <p>
    Getting a good grade is of the highest priority so cheating is the choice you go with. When the test 
  ends a wave of confidence and relief washes over you as you know you just aced your test. Life is good 
and will continue on as it should. But was it right? As you sit down into your history class a feeling 
of guilt starts to take hold as you know that you just betrayed your teachers trust and your academic 
integrity is in question. Your teacher breaks your train of thought as they drop a test in front of your 
face. You realize today is a test day for most classes. However, unlike for math, you did study for this 
test. You don't need to cheat this time... but you could. You may have studied but your phone can carry 
you to another perfect grade. You will never have to study again in fact. It's so tempting. Do you 
 <a href="../endings/continue to cheat.html">give into cheating</a> or do you 
 <a href="../endings/quit cheating.html">do your own work?</a></p>
